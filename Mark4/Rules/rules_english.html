    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Here is a short and sweet introduction to the game Mastermind:</p>

    <p>1. The code maker first creates his secret code,
          for example: <code>green blue yellow red</code></p>

    <p>2. After the code is created, it is the turn of the code breaker. He has to find out the code within 7 rounds.</p>

    <p>3. After each round, the code breaker receives feedback as to whether the code entered was correct.
          The code maker has the option of displaying his feedback using white and pink (since you can't see black well) dots:</p>

    <p><span class="highlight1">white</span> = correct color but in the wrong position</p>
    <p><span class="highlight2">pink</span> = Color and position are correct</p>
